# node-red-contrib-ccxt-v3

A Node-RED node to communicate with various crypto exchanges using [CCXT](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt) library. The node now supports all Unified and Exchange-specific APIs.

Note this package is *almost a rewrite* and is not to be used with the original node. The node will possibly have its own namespace and new upgrade. This node has much more added features and changes from the original fork, so this is refactored to v2 only to keep using the name for the time being!

This is now in Beta testing with really cool new features as below :) Please create an issue for any question or suggestion.

**New Features**

- Automatic load of all unified and custom (exchange-specific) APIs.
- Supports a call to multiple exchanges at one time and for multiple markets !
- Now only the supported APIs by the exchange will be listed. TODO: configuration for overrides.
- Automatic detection of private and public APIs based on exchange capabilities. Private APIs only require API Key and Secret. TODO : support overrides.
- Links for the selected exchange API docs.
- Automatic detection of required and optional parameters for the selected Exchange.
- Dynamic flow input parameters.
- Cool searable drop-down lists based on select2 for easily finding the exchange or required API.
- much more to come ...
